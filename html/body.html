        A Helix researcher analyst is tasked to relive the memories of an assassin-turned templar,

        them again under their supervisor, <strong>Violet da Costa</strong>.<br><br>

        We are shown an assassin Shay chasing his friend and fellow assassin, <strong>Liam O'Brien
        </strong>. After hearing cannon fire, they run to the camp, where <strong>Louis-Joseph
        Gaultier, Chevalier de la Vérendrye</strong> is waiting for them. A fist fight ensues, which is
        stopped by Liam. Shay makes his way to the British camp, kills their soldiers and claims their
        ship [and names it the <strong>Morrigan</strong>]. They helped Chevalier's ship, the <strong>
        Gerfaut</strong> .<br>

        Shay travels to Lisbon and activate the artifact, only to see it disintegrate and result in
        an earthquake which led to a huge loss of life and property. Devastated to see the accident,
        he confronts his mentor, who turns him off. Seeing that the others won't listen to his
        reason, Shay sneaked into the room and stole the Manuscript, but was discovered by Achilles.
        He tried to flee and arrived at a dead-end, and was shot by Liam.<br><br>

                    "It's a bloody marvelous time to be alive, so many clever blokes dreaming up
                    impossible machines. Hoarding away more gold than Queen Victoria herself. But
                    none of those shillings ever make it into the hands of the poor devils whose
                    blood is spilled building this marvelous empire, the working class sleep-walks
                    through life, unaware of the machine that drives them. Let's wake them up then,
                    shall we?"
